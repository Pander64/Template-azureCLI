The next few pages will go over each of the parts in more detail. A task list has been provided in each section for you to keep track of each step.

Note: In case you need to return to the project later on, it is suggested to store any commands you use so you can re-create your work.

Project Submission
Your project will be reviewed based on the criteria in the rubric. Once you have completed all of the requirements, you will submit either a zipped folder with your files or your GitHub repo.

IMPORTANT:

Please make sure to delete or stop resources in your resource group in Azure after receiving your grade for this course to avoid being billed for any running services when your free account with Azure expires.
